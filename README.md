  Files to copy paste into VSCode Project directory. I did not make these files, I got them from the channel
  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ivOTE5EgpmF2DHLBmWIWg">Programming With Nick</a>.
</p>

  I only uploaded the files I need to make this process as seamless as possible for myself.
